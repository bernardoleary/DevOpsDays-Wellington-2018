# DevOpsDays-Wellington-2018

## "AI for DevOps" Workshop (DevOpsDays Wellington 2018)

https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-wellington/program/bernard-oleary/

## Workshop Requirements

Weâ€™ll be working through developing a custom machine learning solution for predicting whether a pull-request (or code merge) will result in a bug.

There will be some maths content, but it will be relatively light and hopefully I will explain it all well enough.

People will need to have the following installed (all of this works on any platform - Windows/Linux/Mac):

* Git version control software
* Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/install
* Python (which is a prerequisite for Jupyter anyway)
* Pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
* Python libraries:
    * sklearn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
    * numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
    * pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
    * matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/

Will spend a few minutes at the start of the tutorial making sure that everyone has these setup correctly anyway.
