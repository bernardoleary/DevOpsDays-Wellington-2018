# DevOpsDays-Wellington-2018

## "AI for DevOps" Workshop (DevOpsDays Wellington 2018)

https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-wellington/program/bernard-oleary/

## Workshop Requirements

Weâ€™ll be working through developing a custom machine learning solution for predicting whether a pull-request (or code merge) will result in a bug.

There will be some maths content, but it will be relatively light and hopefully I will explain it all well enough.

People will need to have the following installed (all of this works on any platform - Windows/Linux/Mac):

* Git: https://git-scm.com/
* Postman (or equivalent): https://www.getpostman.com/
* A code editor (Bernard will be using VS Code)
* Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/install
* Python (prerequisite for Jupyter): https://www.python.org/
* Pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
* Python libraries:
    * SKLearn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
        * $ pip install scikit-learn
    * Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
        * $ pip install pandas
    * Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
        * $ pip install flask
        * $ pip install flask_debug
    * Optional libraries:
        * MatPlotLib: https://matplotlib.org/
        * NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/        

Will spend a few minutes at the start of the tutorial making sure that everyone has these setup correctly anyway.
